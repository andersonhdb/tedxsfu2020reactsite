Having travelled the world in search of creating new stories for myself, I have worked vigorously to hone my craft as an artist and storyteller. More recently I have involved myself in climate/racial activism. In the wake of COVID19 and the rise of Anti-Asian racism paired with the George Floyd protests, I spent much of my energy getting the conversation started on racial justice in my rural community of Fort St John, BC. Real change only comes if there are those who are willing to have conversations on the uncomfortable topics.</p>,
